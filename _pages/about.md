Hi ğŸ‘‹ğŸ˜„!

I'm Barry Xue, a graduate M.S. student at the University of Toronto studying computer science. I'm also a co-op computational research scientist at Sanofi's Digital R&D department. Before this, I've received my B.S. from the University of San Diego in the HalÄ±cÄ±oÄŸlu Data Science Institute.

Right now, my interest is the application of deep learning in modeling molecular sequences and structures, i.e. RNA, antibody, and smaller proteins. I'm also exploring opportunities to utilize generative models in clinical applications.

Over the years, I've worked on:

- Interpretability of deep vision models ğŸ‘€
- Machine learning in drug development pipeline ğŸ’Š
- Graph generation with Graph Neural Network ğŸ“Š
