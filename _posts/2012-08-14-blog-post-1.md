I need to review the derivation of joint entropy calculation of variables that follows a Gaussian probability density function, and I came across this amazing piece of writing by Daniel F. Savarese on Gaussian Integrals. [(*Link to Paper*)](https://www.savarese.org/math/gaussianintegral.html)

This isn't a hard read, but it does contain some detail derivations. Highly recommend reading this from the beginning to the end.
